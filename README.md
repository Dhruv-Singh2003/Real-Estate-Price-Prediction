**🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction:** 
This project aims to predict real estate prices based on various property features using machine learning algorithms. The model helps users estimate property prices, assisting buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.

**📖 About the Project:**
This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict house prices based on features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. The project includes:

    Data preprocessing and cleaning

    Feature engineering

    Model training and evaluation

    Deployment-ready pipeline

**💻 Tech Stack:**
      Python 3.x
      
      Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
      
      Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
      
      Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
      
      Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

**📊 Dataset:**
The dataset used contains various features related to real estate listings.

You can find the dataset here (Replace with your dataset link or upload it to the repo).

Features include:

          Location
          
          Size (sqft)
          
          Number of Bedrooms
          
          Number of Bathrooms
          
          BHK
          
          Price

**📈 Results:**
Achieved R² Score: e.g., 0.85 on test data

Best performing model: e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest

Visualizations included:

        Price distribution
        
        Feature correlations
        
        Actual vs Predicted plots

**🔮 Future Improvements:**
Use advanced models like XGBoost or CatBoost

Include location-based clustering

Deploy using Streamlit or Flask

Add more data for better accuracy

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
